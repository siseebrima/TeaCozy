# TeaCozy
This is a project to create a fictional website for a tea shop. I intend to improve the code and and possibly colaborate with other developers and make something even more amazing.
For now it is a public repository and I intended to keep it that way until further notice. 

Any front-end developer can clone this repository and improve this website.
